About the Austin Animal Center
Grazioso Salvare’s project consists of the database and client-facing web application that will use existing data from Austin animal shelters.  The software application will serve to identify and categorize available dogs for search and rescue training. It will also allow users to create, read, update, and remove from the database. 

Motivation
When databases and API are used correctly they increase the ability to search larger data sets quickly based off either specific information or general. In our case for Grazioso Salvare’s we created a query that organizes their database by breed, age, and sex allowing the staff to locate their guest more easily.

Getting Started
To get started you’ll need to add our database to your Linux shell. You can do this by importing Austin Animal Center (AAC). You can then use our client facing application to conduct searches of animals currently at our shelter. Note: Be sure to use database animals once imported.

•	Install the MongoDB and Python drivers needed. 
•	Download the following files into your Mongo Directory: 
o	aac_shelter_outcomes.csv
o	CRUD.PY
o	CRUD_test.py

Installation
To install our application please visit the appropriate app store. For developers you can access our installation instructions found below. 


1.	Login using authentication
2.	Once logged in import Austin Animals Database. 
3.	After installation of our database, you can use our query functions to do controlled searches. 


Usage
Our application works a few different ways. As a provider or employee of Austin Animal Center you can easily add animals into the database. If you’re a developer, you can create queries that call our database to gather information. You will need to be an authorized user, however. 



Code Example
 


Tests
To run a test, you can write a test script to call our database to gather information about a specific animal or group of animals. Your test should return results if it matches any of the criteria contained within our database.
